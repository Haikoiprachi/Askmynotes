### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Haikoiprachi/Askmynotes.git
cd AskMyNotes
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
#### Windows
```bash
python -m venv .venv   #creating the enviroment
.venv\Scripts\activate   #activating the enviroment
```
#### Linux / macOS
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv   #creating the enviroment
source .venv/bin/activate   #activating the enviroment
```
#### If you are using VS Code you can also do this for activating your enviroment:
```ruby
Ctrl+Shift+P > Python Interpreter > select the one which you have created in your working directory i.e. AskMyNotes
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the project root:
```ruby
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
python -m streamlit run AskMyNotes.py
```

### If you want to exit the virtual enviroment
just write ``deactivate`` in the terminal where virtual enviroment is active.

Virtual enviroment only affects python, it has nothing to do with git commands.
